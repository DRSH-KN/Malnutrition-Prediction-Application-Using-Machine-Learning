Child malnutrition condition can be considered as a major health issue for a 
country since the children are the future workforce which directly affects the 
economic growth of the country. Proper nutrition is an essential component for 
the survival, growth, and development of children in society. Malnutrition is a 
global problem in today’s life. The primary target of this phenomenon is children 
under five years of age and mostly for developing countries. In this system, a data 
science machine learning approach is proposed to predict the malnutrition status 
of children under five years of age based on the training data-sets. Training data
sets downloaded from www.kaagle.com. Some hidden factors were extracted with 
the use of machine learning techniques. Classification techniques used for 
malnutrition status prediction. We use algorithms such as “bayesian classifier” 
and “K-nearest neighbor” for prediction. The results will be compared and 
efficient algorithm will be identified. By testing and validating the knowledge, 
preventive actions can be taken with the help of medical experts to reduce the 
malnutrition condition among children for applicable countries. We build this as 
real time application useful for the society. To build real time application we use 
technologies such as “Visual Studio” as front end technology and “SQL server” as 
back end technology. Both the tools are powerful tools to work with real time 
application. This system defines how data science classification techniques can 
classify malnutrition status for children under five years of age. Generally, our 
method will obtained the most robust results to predict the malnutrition status 
based on clinical data-sets.
